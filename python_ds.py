# A "suit" is an integer in the range 0..3, where 0=Clubs, 1=Diamonds, 2=Hearts, 3=Spades
SUIT = []

# A "rank" is an integer in the range 0..12, where 0 = 2 (deuce), 1 = 3, 11 = King, 12 = Ace.
rank = []

# A "card" is an integer in the range 0..51, hence
# card = suit*13 + rank.
# Suit = card/13
# Rank = card%13
